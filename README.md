                                    Implement monitoring and set up alerts for key AWS resources to ensure proactive detection of issues.

1. Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications.

2. The CloudWatch home page automatically displays metrics about every AWS service you use. You can additionally create custom dashboards to display metrics about your custom applications, and display custom collections of metrics that you choose.

                 Configuration of AWS CloudWatch alarms that monitor critical metrics (e.g.,CPU utilization, memory usage) for each resource.

   1. Configuring AWS CloudWatch alarms to monitor critical metrics like CPU utilization and memory usage for each resource (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS databases) is crucial for ensuring the health and performance of your AWS infrastructure. Here's a detailed explanation of how to set up CloudWatch alarms for these metrics:
  
                               Step 1: Log in to AWS Console
                               Step 2: Navigate to CloudWatch
                               Step 3: Create an Alarm
                               Step 4: Choose Metric
                               Step 5: Select Resource
                               Step 6: Select Metric and Statistic
                               Step 7: Define Conditions
                               Step 8: Set Actions
                               Step 9: Name and Describe Alarm
                               Step 10: Create the Alarm
